## **Introduction**

Regular expressions (regex) are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. They are widely used in programming, text processing, and data extraction tasks. This repository aims to provide a central location for developers to find and contribute regular expressions for different purposes.

## **Usage**

Each regular expression in this repository is organized into its own file and is accompanied by a brief description and examples of its usage. You can browse through the files to find the specific pattern you need or search for a keyword in the repository to narrow down your results.

To use a regular expression from this repository, you can simply copy the pattern and integrate it into your own code. Be sure to adjust any necessary syntax or language-specific requirements to match your programming environment.

## **Contributing**

I welcome contributions from the community to expand and improve the Regular Expression Repository. If you have a regular expression that you find useful or want to enhance an existing pattern, follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch for your contribution.
3. Add your regular expression file to the appropriate category or create a new category if necessary.
4. Include a clear description of the pattern and provide relevant examples.
5. Submit a pull request to the main repository.
